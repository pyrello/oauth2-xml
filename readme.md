# OAuth2 XML (For Laravel)

Add-on package for https://github.com/lucadegasperi/oauth2-server-laravel which can provide an XML response. This package was developed because of a specific use-case where a client was not able to use json for api interaction at all. It is probably not useful unless you have the exact same use-case.
